## Contributions to the Community🔥

  I’m new to the development community and have yet to make any significant contributions to any documentation, etc however it is one of the major goals I plan to achieve by the end of the year.  Here are my top 3 contribution goals as a developer before the end of 2023

**Open Source Contributions**  🫶🏽
  -I've been told by several experienced developers that contributing to open-source projects is a great way to give back to the developer community. 
  -I plan to explore some existing issues, submit bug fixes or add new features, and of course, collaborate with other developers on projects that align with my interests, but first I have to find those projects.  
  -__Any advice on how you go about finding new projects that align with your interests in order to contribute to the community is appreciated!!. This not only helps improve the project but also allows you to
    learn from experienced developers._

**Mentoring and Support**: 👩🏽‍🏫
  -I know from personal experience that offering mentorship and support to fellow developers can make a significant impact. 
  -I plan to join online communities, forums, and/or Slack channels related to frontend development and help to answer questions, provide guidance, and share resources. 
  -I was also considering participating in hackathons or organized workshops to help others learn new skills and technologies while also learning from others.
  - __Any suggestions on how I can best get my feet wet in mentoring and support in the community are welcome!!_
 
**Sharing Knowledge**:
  -I've recently discovered that sharing knowledge and personal experience can be both therapeutic and a valuable way to give back.
  -While building my blog post I discovered it to be a great outlet to recap on all I've learned while hopefully sharing information with others that might be helpful to them.
  -Blog posts, tutorials, video tutorials, or giving talks at conferences and meetups are all future possibilities.
  -By sharing my insights, tips, and tricks I hope to help other new developers learn and grow.
